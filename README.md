# Slideshow Presentation for Bowl Rebel App
## Google UX Design Certificate Portfolio Project

A presentation of my portfolio project -  a food customisation app for an imaginary grab-and-go restaurant called Bowl Rebel. The app is designed for a range of users who want more flexibility and menu filtering options to cater for their dietary needs.

The website itself serves as a web design portfolio. It incorporates newly learned HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. It is responsive, using CSS @media queries for a range of device sizes and uses Javascript to provide interactivity for the slideshow presentation.

## Site Structure

12 Column grid 960px layout, fixed width columns, responsive layout.
